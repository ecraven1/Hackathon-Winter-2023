# Hackathon-Winter-2023
FitVid

The purpose of this project is to give users a recommended exercise video based on their preferences. 

Using this information, the program will then direct the user to a randomized video that fits these preferences. This allows the program to not only be useful for someone who doesnâ€™t have a lot of knowledge in the exercise space, but to also give an experienced user something different/new to try. The videos linked will provide all the information the user needs, including workout regime and explanations of those exercises from a professional.
