# Hackathon-Winter-2023

Description of Project: The purpose of this project is to give users a recommended exercise video based on their preferences. It will ask users
- The length of workout, depending on their preference
- the type of workout they are interested in for the day
- How intense that workout should be

Using this information, the program will then direct the user to a randomized video that fits these preferences. This allows the program to not only be useful for someone who doesnâ€™t have a lot of knowledge in the exercise space, but to also give an experienced user something different/new to try. The videos linked will provide all the information the user needs, including workout regime and explanations of those exercises from a professional.
