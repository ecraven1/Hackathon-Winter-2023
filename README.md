# Hackathon-Winter-2023
Should we explain how everything works here?
I'll copy paste what we have in google docs for now

A website that finds a workout video for you based on what you’re looking for (length of workout, intensity, muscle group to focus on, etc)
(Languages used: Python/Flask (backend), HTML (frontend))

Project steps:

1) Learn the basics of Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.   
2) Choose a web framework for Python , such as Flask or Django, to handle the backend of the website.
3)Choose a database to store information about the fitness video clips (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite).
4) Create a web page template using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the recommended video clips.
*Use Javascript to create interactive elements on the website, such as buttons and drop-down menus to filter the recommended video clips.     
5) Use Python to create the backend logic for the website, including fetching and displaying the recommended video clips from the database.
6) Test the website locally and make any necessary adjustments.
7)??? Deploy the website to a web server or hosting service.

For this project, we will focus on backend with visual mockup, and if we have time we can add frontend.

I’m thinking the website should ask the user about:
Desired length of workout
Short (10 - 20min)
Medium (30 - 45min)
Long (1 - 1:30hr)

Type of workout
Muscle growth
How far down the rabbit hole do we want to go here? Muscle types? Or just a few general possibilities (upper body, lower body, etc). May just be a wait and see thing, but I don’t want to be too unrealistic.
Add a few core workouts to the end of every workout?
Depending on what muscle group the user selects, will there be a randomly generated workout for that muscle group, or is it the same everytime?
Cardio
1 mile, 2 miles, 5k, 10k for distance workouts
100m, 200m, 300m, 400m repeats for shorter higher intensity workouts
Cardio bike, elliptical, treadmill, stairmaster for gym cardio workouts
Basketball/soccer/racquetball/pickleball options for team sports?
Full body
Kinda like a “hybrid” workout where it takes various workouts from different muscle groups and adds some cardio also?

	Yoga maybe?
		- hatha (gentle)
		- vinyasa (cardio)


Intensity
Low (restorative, stretching)
Medium
High (HIIT?)
